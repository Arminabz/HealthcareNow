#### Example of User Stories:

    • I am a F1 visa student. I go to the gym a lot. I have noticed occasionally that I tend to strain some of my muscles after a hard work out.  I am looking for the best insurance plan for me in case I injure myself.* 

    • I am a 25-year-old who is about to be dropped from my parent’s health plan. I engage in multiple risky behaviors in addition to  having multiple mental health problems.  I want to have a health plan that will address my needs for the lowest cost.*

    • I am a 23-year-old student who just found out I am pregnant. I still haven’t decided what I want to do so I’d like to know my    different options regarding abortion, adoption, and maternal child health.*

    • I am uninsured and have been recently diagnosed with cervical cancer. I would like to know what services and treatments are      available to me.

    • Currently, I am a 20-year-old student who is in the middle of joining a sorority. I have decided to live in the house owned by my sorority. I blacked out and slept with a guy and did not realize that protection was not used. After being in pain and noticed a      rash, I consulted Web MD. I have realized there is a high chance that I contracted herpes. I hope there is a plan the offers a reduced cost on generic drugs.*

    • I am a 22-year-old transgender female who was recently diagnosed with HIV. This situation prompted me to stop using crystal meth. I need rehabilitation services and long-term HIV care.  In addition, I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, therefore I need dialectical behavioral therapy.*
